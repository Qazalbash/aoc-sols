# [Advent of Code - Solutions][AOC]

You will find the solution of problems that I happen to solve, that are available on [Advent of Code][AOC]. This adventure is an opportunity for me to practice Rust programming language.

## Repository Structure

Each directory in this repository represents a day of the challenge, containing my solutions and notes for that day's puzzles.

```bash
aoc-sols
├── year
│   └── dayN
│       ├── src
│       │   ├── input.rs
│       │   └── lib.rs
│       ├── Cargo.lock
│       └── Cargo.toml
└── README.md
```

## How to Run the Solutions

```bash
cd year/dayN
cargo test
```

## Contributing

While this is a personal project for Advent of Code, I am open to suggestions and discussions. Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or suggestions.
